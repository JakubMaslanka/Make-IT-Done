## General Information

- Make-IT-Done is an application that helps increase the productivity of daily tasks. It's composed of 3 smaller applications such as To-Do, Calendar, and Pomodoro timer. Provides some practical views to help the user manage his tasks. The application also requires user authentication, JSON-server-auth library takes care of it. App has been adapted to work on mobile devices and wide screens.

- The application is targeting unorganized people who have problems with keeping their focus on one task. Make-It-Done allows users to create a task, estimate how much time is needed to complete it, and then work on it with 4x25min, 3x5min, and 1x15min intervals.

- The project was created mainly to test my skills in writing React apps. 
  Make-it-done is a specific culmination of the [course](https://kursreacta.pl/) provided by MichaÅ‚ Taszycki.

## Setup

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). So the setup is pretty simple. Just make sure that on your local development machine is installed Node 14.0.0 or later version.

Then clone this repository and run the command:

`npm install`

When all dependencies are installed, run the command:

`npm start`

## Project Status

The project is **pre-completed**, the main functionalities it provides are complete. However, I have plans to develop the app in the future.

## Future Plans

Future Plans:

- Replace backend for dedicated Express server, handling API and user authentication. Currently, the project is based on JSON-server and JSON-server-auth. I'd like to abandon this solution and switch to my own backend.
- Add more information about the task completing progress. Statistics showing how much time we put into the specific task, activity graphs, and so on.
- Add the possibility of interaction between users. 
I'd like users to be able to send tasks among themselves or assign them to other logged-in users.
